### Context

I design boardgames, but I am horrible at drawing a fast way of a layout for the cards. The task of having specific software to do a prototype-level design of a few layouts of cards for my game is just horrible (steep learning curve in Adobe for example), and just take my hope to prototype some of my games.

So, as a programmer, i decided to do a mini-project: `prototype-card-generator`. With it you can accomplish the following:
* Prepare your card layouts for your games
* After the design for the fields, just fill the form to create a new instance of a card!
* Export it in .PNG file (To print for your physical prototype or to export on Table Top Simulator)
* Organize your Layouts per games on the project
* Save locally on your computer

And this project is the Result! As a prototype of this project (no pun intended), you can design your own layouts for how many games you like. Have fun and good prototyping!

## Features

#### Organize yourself
Create, edit and delete the layouts as you like! Tag each layout on a specific Game for more organization!

#### Like a form
Easy to use, just fill the form and press "Export" to quicly generate the .PNG file!

#### Your Layout, your way
Create and edit the fields for your layouts. Define the position and the width/height, plus more style to put your layout alive for each field!
